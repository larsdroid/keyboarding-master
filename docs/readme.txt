=== Notes === 
This release works on 32-bit & 64-bit linux systems.
keyboarding master depends on jinput with modifications.  My modifications
to jinput only support linux at this time.

* Requires Sun's JRE version 1.7 or above *

=== Instructions For Use ===
BitRocks InstallBuilder automatically installs all necessary components
for keyboarding master to function with your devices except for the java
runtime environment (JRE).  You will need to download and install the JRE.

You can get the jre directly from oracle or from you package management
system.
